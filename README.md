# cinematic-blur
 Background blur plays a major role in making videos cinematic, but most phone cameras cannot achieve it due to limited depth of field. Editing it manually takes time, and deep learning tools like Rembg and Mediapipe add complexity and require large models.  Therefore, in this work, we propose a simpler, faster alternative using classical image processing techniques.
